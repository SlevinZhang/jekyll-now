title: Why the medical images are different from other images in deep learning
---
### 1. specialized dataformat
additional spatial information / 3D images with anisotropic voxels / patient information  
->data loading pipeline
### 2. Large volumetric images  
high resolution  
->data sampling pipeline
### 3. domain-specific data  
->domain-specific data augmentation  

### General deep learning pipeline  
1. model selection  
  Select the best module based on the purpose of application  
2. model evaluation  
  evaluate the model and compare the result with differnt model  
3. model distribution  
  share the model with other users
